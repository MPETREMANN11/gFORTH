<h2>ESP 32 Disassembler</h2>

<p>This is an ambitious project: to make a disassembler for the ESP32 binary code.</p>
<p>Because, before designing an ESP32 assembler, you have to understand the ESP32 code. And the best way is to create an ESP32 disassembler.</p>
<p>To test this disassembler, run gForth:</p>
<pre>gforth Disassembler.txt</pre>
<p>The code will be compiled by gForth.</p>
